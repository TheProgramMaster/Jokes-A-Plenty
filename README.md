# Jokes-A-Plenty
This is a website that uses the JokeAPI to deliver random jokes to the user on command.

Inspiration
One of our members held a love of comedy. This love of comedy served as the chief inspiration for this project.

What it does
This project relies on JavaScript and the Joke API to randomly generate a collection of jokes for the user. PLEASE NOTE AS THIS IS IMPORTANT!!!: The API we utilized, namely Joke API, hold a collection of jokes that are inappropriate for a general audience. These inappropriate jokes include ones that are racist, sexist, religious, political, nsfw, and explicit in their language. The API has a methodology to filter these jokes through flags, otherwise known as blacklist flags. However, the language we used, namely JavaScript, was required to be used by a wrapper of the API that was left untouched by the developer and held no clear manner whatsoever in its documentation on how to make use of said black filter flags. With that being said, please consume this app at your own risk. While we would like to filter this content out completely, we could not, given the developers' limitation, and our time limitation in determining an effective manner in which to do so.

How we built it
We built this application and the website in which it exists in HTML, JavaScript, CSS, Bootstrap, and the Joke API.

Challenges we ran into
As mentioned previously, we ran into the challenge of attempting to filter out any and all inappropriate content in this website for user consumption. Unfortunately, we failed in succeeding in our efforts to filter out said content. Additionally, we held issues in the front-end framework of the application, as the appearance of the contact information section of the website was found to be relative to the user executing the application, possibly in accordance with the technological resources of the user. We also had to change between various programming languages and technological concepts before settling on JavaScript and CSS Bootstrap for this application.

Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud of our success in our efforts to make a functioning software application with various technological capacities, and in implementing a custom API for a designated application for user consumption. We are also proud of translating the text to robot speech in JavaScript through the Google Cloud API.

What we learned
We learned how to make use of the CSS Bootstrap, how to implement various APIs in JavaScript, and how to translate String text to robot speech. Additionally, we studied various topics in our efforts to improve this project as we worked on it, even though we did not implement said technologies in our application. These miscellaneous technologies include Deso, Twilio, and Python Flask.

What's next for Make Me Laugh
We seek to fix the error in which inappropriate jokes are given by the application. This could be solved using a new JavaScript Wrapper created by the developer just recently. We could also remake this application in the wrapper of a different programming language, of which may include Python, Rust, and/or Go.
